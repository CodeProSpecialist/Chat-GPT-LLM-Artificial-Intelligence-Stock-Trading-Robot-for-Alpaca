  **Introducing The Chat GPT LLM Artificial Intelligence Stock Trading Robot ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¼**
**Unlock the Power of AI Trading with Our Cutting-Edge Stockbot!**
**Maximize Your Returns with Advanced Strategies and Real-time Insights!**

This is currently CodeProSpecialist's favorite Trading Robot. 
Now the Artificial Intelligence stock market robot can trade 16 hours per day. I enabled trading from 4am until 8pm on this AI robot. This is a gigantic game changer for potential increases 
in profits. 

I recommend downloading the newest version of this Python Robot. 
New Updates and more features were added on July 3, 2024.  

I recommend running this AI robot in the Operating System Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS. 

There is a new feature called the Task Scheduler. 

The Task Scheduler helps to increase Stock Market profits by 
scheduling sell orders at profit selling strategy times and it displays the following 
messages, depending on when the Stock Market is Open: 

Scheduler tasks thread successfully started. 

Task Scheduler is waiting for the Stock Market trading hours to start running.

Task Scheduler: scheduling sell orders at profit selling strategy times. 

------------------------------------
This robot has a maximum profit strategy for buying and selling 
at the perfect times. It only buys and sells at certain strategic times 
for being able to generate the best 
results. 
The recommended time to start this 
AI Robot is 4:00 AM Eastern time. 
------------------------------------

The best results have been with the AI model named: 
  llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0
Llama 3 has expert stock market trading knowledge, knows what the technical analysis indicators mean, 
and Llama 3 knows the correct trade to make in response 
to changing market conditions. 
It is recommended to have greater than or equal to 8 Gigabytes of VRAM on an Nvidia video card 
when running this Artificial Intelligence Stock Market Trading Robot. 

The following screen pictures were with llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0

The below picture is an example of how the llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0 
brain model can analyze the stock market data.
I modified the def trading_robot 
function content to obtain some stock analysis text that was printed on 
the screen. The printed stock market data analysis text slows down the trading robot, and is not always necessary for the trading robot to work.

Llama 3 prefers this Artificial Intelligence stock market trading robot exactly how it is designed right now. 

Llama 3's advice on how to provide stock market data for decision making: 

As a Large Language Model (LLM), I can process and analyze both numerical data and visual charts, but I'm more efficient and accurate when working with structured numerical data. In the case of price data, I would prefer to receive the data in a format that includes the following columns:* Date* Open* High* Low* Close* Volume* Bollinger Bands ( Upper, Middle, Lower)* RSI (Relative Strength Index)* Moving Averages (e.g., 50-day, 100-day, 200-day) Having this data in a tabular format allows me to quickly process and analyze it using various algorithms and techniques. I can then generate insights, identify patterns, and make predictions based on the data. While I can try to extract information from charts and graphs, it's not as efficient or accurate as working with structured numerical data. Charts and graphs are better suited for human visual analysis, whereas numerical data is more suitable for machine learning models like myself.

It is recommended to first install Anaconda3 to setup a Python 3 virtual environment. 

Place the stock symbols that you would like to trade into the

One stock symbol per line. 
If a stock symbol has a hyphen ( BRK-B ), then 
replace the hyphen with a ( . ) dot. 
So, the stock symbol in the list would be 
correctly typed as BRK.B

Place your alpaca code keys in the location: /home/name-of-your-home-folder/.bashrc Be careful to not delete the entire .bashrc file. Just add the 4 lines to the bottom of the .bashrc text file in your home folder, then save the file. .bashrc is a hidden folder because it has the dot ( . ) in front of the name. Remember that the " # " pound character will make that line unavailable. To be helpful, I will comment out the real money account for someone to begin with an account that does not risk using real money. The URL with the word "paper" does not use real money. The other URL uses real money. Making changes here requires you to reboot your computer or logout and login to apply the changes.

The 4 lines to add to the bottom of .bashrc are:

export APCA_API_KEY_ID='zxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxz'

export APCA_API_SECRET_KEY='zxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzx'

#export APCA_API_BASE_URL='https://api.alpaca.markets'

export APCA_API_BASE_URL='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'
